  "text": "Jordan worked with me to redesign and replace my front porch after the earthquake.  They also replaced my fence gates. He was very patient due to delays with other work needing to be done first.\nMatthew was the main carpenter and angled the walkway and porch boards. I love the artistic uniqueness of the way the front porch turned out. Also, the redone gates easily swing open with little effort.\nI would recommend this company for any deck or fence work. They do a top notch job. I hope to eventually replace my fence and will be calling Deck Masters when I do.",
