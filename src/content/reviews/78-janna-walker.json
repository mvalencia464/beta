  "text": "Jordan has a wonderful company staffed with competent and reliable people. They have been very responsive to what I've needed to be done and they were willing to make changes/additions/subtractions as needed. They work in any kind of weather to make sure the job is done right! They have built a deck, porch, and fence for my property. Jordan also has very good relationships with other contractors in the construction industry. It took so much pressure off of me to know he was coordinating with the landscaper, pile drivers, and driveway company.",
