  "text": "This summer, we hired Deck Masters to build out our second story deck. From the initial consultation with Jordan to the final product, my wife and I were very happy with the entire process. Every question we had was answered and Jordan gave us great recommendations based on his years of experience, which helped us narrow down our decisions. During the build, Jeff, the foreman, and his team, Robert and Rayne, were friendly, professional, and efficient. They completed absolutely beautiful work.",
