  "text": "My experience with Deck Masters, was overall pretty great. We had some issues with communication initially with an employee that is no longer in the role, but Jordan, Andrew, and Jackie were able to straighten everything out before the scheduled date the project was set to begin. Even companies that perform at a high level end up going through some rough spots, and in my opinion it's not whether or not those rough spots happen, but how they handle them. Deck Masters handled it fantastically.\n\nI had a simple small 2nd floor back deck that needed to be replaced, ours was original from 45yrs ago, and was in awful condition. Their demo crew came out and had it down in about an hour, and the trash gone 30min later. About 2 weeks later, their build crew came out, and had the deck done in less than 24hrs. Now my wife and I will need our front deck redone just to match! Thank you guys for helping us out. We love the New Deck.",
