  "text": "We had our deck replaced by Jordan and his team, and the experience was fantastic from start to finish. They were honest, up front, and truly a pleasure to work with. Our project involved replacing a small second-story deck with a much larger one made from Trex, which was no small feat given the complexities of permitting, tight utility corridors, and the installation of pilings.\n\nDespite these challenges, Jordan and his team delivered a beautiful result. Our new deck receives compliments constantly from neighbors and passersby. Moreover, they stood by their warranty and replaced a center support beam that had developed a large crack. Although the crack did not compromise the integrity of the beam, they wanted to ensure our complete satisfaction and replaced it without hesitation.\n\nWe highly recommend Jordan and his team for their professionalism, craftsmanship, and dedication to customer satisfaction.",
