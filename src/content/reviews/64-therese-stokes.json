  "text": "Once Two Seasons showed up on site, they worked steadily, with high quality and attention to detail. However, they appeared about a month later than expected, after many delays. The five star rating stands because we signed a contract without a completion date. The wrong railing material was delivered, which we fortunately discovered before installation. This was corrected and the specified materials were delivered rapidly. Also, the first crew members on site were unsure of the deck width dimension. Both problems would not have happened if the crew had had a copy of the plans and a materials list. That said, due to the quality of their work and their professionalism, we would definitely work with them again.",
