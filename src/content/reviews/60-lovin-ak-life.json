They went above and beyond what we asked for & couldn't be happier with our new decks.\n\nWe will be enjoying them for many years to come & we would totally recommend them to anybody looking for a quality built decking that is made to last through the Alaska seasons.\n\nTimewise was longer than we hoped, but Jordan made it right and was sure to be prompt when asking for questions answered.  Very professional & friendly to do business with, & we will be doing business again for future deck builds.\n\nSome below \"before & after\" pictures of the decks, so you can see the difference in quality & craftmanship for yourselves.\n\nThank You Jordan & the Crew, you guys rock!!!!",
