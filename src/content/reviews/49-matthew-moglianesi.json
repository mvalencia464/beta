I wasn\u2019t present for the \u201cestimate\u201d, but from my wife\u2019s account it was wholly unprofessional. No measurements taken with the assurance that we would have an estimate by the end of the week. 2 weeks later no phone call, email, text or estimate and it\u2019s clear this \u201ccompany\u201d is out to scam people. Beware!",
