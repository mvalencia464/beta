They are not only hard working, but were enjoyable to be around.  They are just good people.  Justin (the lead foreman)  is a perfectionist and an artist.  We are very fortunate that we found Deck Masters.  It was a very enjoyable process from the first meeting with Kevin to the completion of the project with Jordan.  We give Deck Masters our highest recommendation.",
