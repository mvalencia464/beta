Despite the February weather they quickly removed all of the rotten/ broken decking and supports. Without asking they explained the repair process. Why they were doing what and why it was being done that way. The new wood was fitted into place with what, looked easy-going to me. The mess was cleaned up and the job was finished in\njust  two days.\nI also want to thank Jackie for putting up with my phones calls. She kept me posted as to my progress on the wait list. She was always polite and upbeat.\n\nTHANKS TO ALL\nMIKE SHAUGHNESSY",
