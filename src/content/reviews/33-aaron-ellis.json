  "text": "I chose to work with Deck Masters this last summer to rebuild our deck.  Jordan and his team were responsive and transparent through the entire project. We ran in to a few obstacles over the course of the project and Jordan was there evey step of the way to answer questions and help troubleshoot. Jackie was always helpful when Jordan was unavailable to answer questions and relay messages. The on-site crew, Jeff, Robert, and Rayne, were professional and always happy to answer any questions I had. We ended up with a beautiful deck and are very happy customers!",
