  "text": "Due to safety concerns we had to replace the deck on our cabin in Willow. You would think that navigating that process from another state would be challenging. Not the case at all. We were fortunate to get connected to Deck Masters via another contractor. We explained what we wanted, saw and approved the plans and gave the go ahead to proceed. From the start of the project it was understood that we were traveling up there for vacation and the deck needed to be completed before our arrival.\nNot only did Jordan and his team do a great job, they ran into some issues along the way that needed to be addressed and rather than short cut to make something work, we were made aware of these issues so we could play a role in deciding how to proceed. This communication level is key for decision making when you aren't in the same state and seeing the issues in person is not an option.\nI have been a professional sales/customer service person for 20 years which comes with a high expectation when I am the customer. My expectations were exceeded every step of the way. If you need some work done and are looking for somebody you can trust,  you should definitely give these folks a call!",
