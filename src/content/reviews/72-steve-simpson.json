  "text": "For the past month, we have been enjoying the deck Jordan Webb and his team at DeckMasters built for us in Big Lake.  We sought quotes from a handful of builders in the area \u2013 some of whom never even got back to us \u2013 and were pleased to contract with Jordan and his team, who proved to be professional, tidy, and quick.  The demo of our old, dilapidated deck went smoothly and our vision for the new deck combined nicely with Jordan\u2019s recommendations.  During construction, he considered our input and communicated with us regarding any challenges and necessary changes.  The deck he and his team built is well-configured, sturdy, and beautiful.  We love it.  We also enjoyed meeting Jordan\u2019s young family, and appreciated how he served as a positive role model for his children. Jordan is proud of his work, and he has reason to be. We highly recommend Jordan Webb and DeckMasters!\n\nSteve and Jody Simpson\nRocky Lake",
