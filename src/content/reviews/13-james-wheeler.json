  "text": "After a year of attempting to have my deck repaired or rebuilt, I was ready to give up on the project. No shows on bids, \"I'll get back with you\" comments, we are booked, etc. etc. I called Deck Masters. A representative came within a few days, made a rough drawing with dimensions and gave me preliminary suggestions and ideas. A short time later I received a bid (lower than most big box stores) with a detailed explanation of construction steps, fees, lumber sizes, supports required, and a lot of other detailed information. I was amazed at the details. I accepted the contract and set a completion date. The work was truly amazing. The old deck was removed with no damage to the existing house, and all was hauled away. A framework was constructed that looked bomb proof. When the Trex decking was applied it truly became a masterpiece with their picture frame method. When the railing was added the deck became a work of art. I was totally satisfied that all my questions had been answered patiently. Any suggestions I had were considered. If I wanted something that was not construction worthy, the lead worker let me know and explained why. All of the workers appeared highly trained and aware of their responsibilities. The office was in contact with me during construction and boosted my confidence. When the deck was completed, I was sort of glad that all the previous contractors had dropped out, maybe that was good. The new deck has enhanced the appearance of my home. I highly recommend folks take their time with a deck project to insure they get the best. That is what I got with Deck Masters AK.",
