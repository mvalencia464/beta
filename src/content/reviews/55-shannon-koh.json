  "text": "When my husband said he wanted a new deck I was like oh boy... here we go dealing with unresponsive contractors, haggling with quotes and playing phone tags...\nTo my surprise, Deck Masters reached out right away and either called or showed up in person to discuss any changes/issues.\nWe instantly appreciated Jordan's responsiveness and detailed explanation over the phone which is hard to find these days.\nSpecial kudos to Isaac and Robert who have been flexible to accommodate the changes/requests along the way.  They have gone above and beyond our expectation.\nI can most definitely recommend Deck Masters (and I rarely recommend!)- good job guys and thank you!",
