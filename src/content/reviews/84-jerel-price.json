  "text": "Deck masters provided excellent service for our new deck project.  They listened to our ideas for how we wanted the deck build.  Deck masters worked with us during construction to ensure the project was completed professionally.  They incorporated our ideas for caps.  Deck masters worked with us when we needed to add cement during construction to ensure we had a big enough landing.  After 2 years, the deck is in great condition.",
