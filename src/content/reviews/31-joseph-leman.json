  "text": "Replacing our 60ftx10ft deck sounded pretty intimidating for me. I put it off for several years, but knew it needed to be done...and built correctly. Jordan and his team at Deck Masters were outstanding through every step. They were so helpful in making decisions, yet never pushy at all. They even encouraged us to get a couple other quotes to make sure we wanted them to go ahead with the project. I thought decks could only be done during the summer, but the Deck Master team built our deck in less than two weeks starting the last week of November. We are excited to use our deck even more during the summer. Thank you, Jordan and team, for a job well done!",
