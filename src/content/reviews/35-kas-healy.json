They were funny, pleasant, professional, efficient, diligent, and worked well as a team.\nThird - they communicated with me. They noticed I have trouble with steps and made the steps easy for me to negotiate (no \u2018Alaska steps\u2019). They made sure t fencing around the porch was \u2018dog proof\u2019 - the porch is in the dog yard.\nFourth - they obviously take pride in their work. Everything is well done, and well finished to the point of being artistic.\nFifth - they were timely and coordinated - it was finished in about a total of 2 days.\nSixth - they cleaned up after themselves.\nAwesome crew. Fantastic job.",
