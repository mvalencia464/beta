  "text": "These pictures do not do this deck justice!  The workmanship is excellent right down to the last detail. But, beyond the obvious is the integrity and professionalism of Deck Masters. Jordan is an amazing young man who has created a quality company with virtue. We contracted them late in the year prior to leaving Alaska for the summer. Jordan\u2019s crew worked during the winter months and we came home to a beautiful new deck in the spring. They took care of every issue, including working with the Muni on permitting.\nThey do what they say they\u2019re going to do. Then they over deliver.  You will not be sorry with Deck Masters.",
