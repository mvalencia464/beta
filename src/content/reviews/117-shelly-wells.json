I had a general idea of what I wanted and they offered some additional suggestions, and I ended up with front and back decks that I love, and my friends and neighbors do, too. They kept me informed at every stage and always gave me at least a week\u2019s advance notice before starting any work. Really great company, wonderful people to work with.",
