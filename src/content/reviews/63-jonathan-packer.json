  "text": "We contracted with Jordan to have them replace our old rickety front and back decks, as well as expand the back deck significantly. Got a little delayed start due to Covid hitting and the initial lockdowns earlier this year, and some delays on the aluminum railing materials due to the pandemic, but our decks are finally complete and we couldn't be happier with the quality of construction. These decks are solid! I appreciated when they offered to extend the back deck out an extra foot at no extra cost so that there would be less wasted decking material, added approximately 40 sq. ft. Justin was meticulous and did a fantastic job! This was the only good thing to come out of 2020.",
