Finally the weather cooperated and they were able to get my project  scheduled the day following my call from Jackie. David was the expert assigned. He was professional and knowledgeable in the area of his tasks, completed the project timely and even built a ramp to assist in putting my snowblower and such into the shed with ease. All in all, it was a little pricey however worth it. I'd recommend Deck Masters to anyone needing exterior home projects done.\nD Dearman",
