  "text": "Deck masters did an outstanding job with our deck; the end product looks excellent. We did have challenges with scheduling our deck construction and ended up having the build about 3 months after anticipated, and also had some minor issues along the way with miscommunication on design features that we picked up during the construction that had to be readjusted. However, I gave the company 5 stars because as soon as these issues were brought to Jordan's attention, he always complied in a professional and timely manner to get it done to our liking. I would recommend this service to others.",
