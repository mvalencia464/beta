  "text": "Via a referral, and after researching a few other deck builders, I contacted Jordan Webb at Deck Masters, formally Two Seasons.  My first hint of the type business Jordan was running was when I was greeted with an immediate response requesting a meeting at the house so he could get a feel for what my wife and would like to have done. No other builder responded to that point, and when they did they basically said for what I wanted done they didn't need to visit the site. Needless to say, I wasn't comfortable with that. Man am I glad Jordan reached out. From the beginning Jordan explained what would happen and what we could expect. It was that way through the whole build. Pretty much right away, when our old deck was demoed and hauled away, they found some water damage under the vinyl siding of the house. They pointed out the problem area and told me they could fix if I wanted it done. They also did some math and explained that if I was ok with it, they could lower the deck where it connected to the house saving material while providing a little relief to my wallet in the process. This type of interaction took place throughout the entire build and I can't stress enough how much this was appreciated. By the time they finished and moved on I felt as though I made some new friends as opposed to a business contact. You simply can't beat that in todays world. I would like to extend a special thank you to Mathew and Trey for the work and attention to detail they provided. I HIGHLY recommend Deck Masters Alaska if you're looking to add a deck to your home. It simply turned out beautiful and right on the money for what we had pictured in our mind prior meeting these gentlemen.",
