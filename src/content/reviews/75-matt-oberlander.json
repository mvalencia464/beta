  "text": "2 years ago we hired this company to rebuild our front deck, install a partial fence-line in the back yard, and upgrade our back deck railing. After 2 hard winters, our property experienced major frost heave which affected the work that had been done. We called and notified the owner of the company, and in under 10 days, he had sent out 2 different representatives from his company to investigate and resolve the issues; at no cost to us, he and his company honored the warranty. If you're looking to build or make upgrades on your property, we would highly recommend this company.",
