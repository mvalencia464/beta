The crew was professional in all aspects of the deck construction.  There were a couple of communication hiccups during the process, but Jordan was very quick to respond and work through any concerns.  I believe Deck Masters truly wants their clients to be completely satisfied with their work and the decks they build.........which we are.  I would definitely recommend Deck Masters to those in the market for a new deck.",
